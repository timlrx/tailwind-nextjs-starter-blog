<YellowCalloutBox emoji="⚠️" title="Limitations">
  While ChatGPT is a powerful tool, developers should be aware of its limitations. Over-relying on
  its suggestions without understanding the reasoning can lead to sub-optimal code. It's vital to
  ensure human oversight in the development process. It doesn't always understand context in the way
  a human does. For instance, in complex projects where there are multiple intertwined systems, a
  solution that might seem apt in isolation might not be the best fit for the broader system.
