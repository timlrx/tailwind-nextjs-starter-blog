> **Did you know?** Pull requests were introduced on February 23rd, 2008, through [this GitHub blog post](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.blog/2008-02-23-oh-yeah-there-s-pull-requests-now/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1695980059280907&usg=AOvVaw0dTbnYFwKFngumNUIRNfdi)! Imagine being the first person ever to ask, 'Hey, can you check my code?' on such a platform. Do you remember your first one?

Pull requests are a cornerstone of collaborative software development for many reasons. They foster collaboration, ensure code quality, and maintain a documented history of changes, making them essential for successful software development.

Some steps can be longer than others. For instance, the time taken for a pull request to merge can range from a few hours to days. The entire life cycle of a PR—from its creation to merge—often averages between one to two weeks. That's why, akin to mastering any art form, understanding and adopting best practices in PR management is crucial.

## 1. PR Journey: A Life Full of Obstacles

Embarking on the journey of a pull request, each phase holds its significance and requires meticulous attention. Just as performance is more than its individual acts, a pull request is more than just code—it's collaboration, feedback, and co-construction.

While it might seem linear, during the whole process, many actors will enter the game, increasing the chances to face issues, making challenges arise like:

### Delayed Reviews due to:

- **Fragmented Communication**: It's easy for team members to lose track of project updates and messages.
- **Ambiguous Feedback**: Vague comments can lead to misunderstandings, requiring further clarification.
- **Context Switching**: Constantly shifting between tasks like coding and reviewing can disrupt focus.

### Merge conflicts due to:

- **Manual Merges**: Merging multiple PRs that modify the same code sections can be error-prone.
- **Repository Maintenance**: For active projects, the sheer volume of pull requests can become overwhelming.
- **Dependency Issues**: New or updated dependencies can introduce compatibility or security concerns.

Addressing these challenges often requires a combination of best practices, clear communication, training, and the right tooling. That’s what we will discuss now.

## 2. Best Practices

The pull request process, foundational to collaborative software development, holds significant stakes. It affects not just the speed, but the very quality and reliability of the code that gets shipped. As such, mastering the intricacies of PRs is paramount. To streamline it, consider these best practices:

- **Promote Clear Communication**: The importance of clarity can't be overstated. Encourage contributors to provide detailed PR descriptions, use clear commit messages, and document any changes. This approach makes it easier for reviewers to understand the context and intent.
- **Limit PR Size**: Encourage developers to make PRs small and focused. Smaller PRs are easier to review, understand, and test. Consider implementing a guideline that suggests breaking down larger tasks into multiple smaller PRs.
- **Adopt Automation**: Utilize tools that automate tasks like code reviewing, merging, and testing. This not only speeds up the process but also minimizes human errors. CI systems can run tests automatically, ensuring that every PR meets the quality benchmarks.
- **Standardize Code Practices**: Establish and enforce coding rules across the team. Utilizing code formatters and linters can help maintain consistency and quality, reducing nit-picking during reviews.
- **Manage Dependencies Proactively**: Implement tools to automatically check and update dependencies. Regularly updating dependencies can prevent compatibility issues and bolster security.

## 3. Tools to Facilitate the PR Process

In the vast realm of software development, certain tools have emerged as game-changers, especially when it comes to simplifying the pull request process:

Incorporating tools like Mergify and Axolo into your PR process doesn't just automate tasks; it elevates the entire workflow. The collaboration becomes more streamlined, dependencies are managed efficiently, and the chances of manual errors significantly reduced.

## 4. The power of automation: Use Case

Imagine Croissant, a tech company navigating the challenges of an ambitious project. With their global team, they often grapple with prolonged review times, ambiguous feedback, manual merges, and outdated dependencies. Here's how integrating Mergify and Axolo can transform their PR process:

### 1. PR Creation Phase:

Hugo, a Croissant developer, completes a new feature and initiates a PR. Axolo springs into action, sending an immediate notification on a dedicated Slack channel during the timeslot Croissant set up previously to review PRs. This visibility prompts swift reviews.

### 2. Review Phase:

Reviewers dive into Hugo’s code. Any feedback or queries are relayed on Slack, and pushed directly on GitHub as PR comments, thanks to Axolo. Hugo is promptly notified of each comment, enabling him to address issues or provide clarifications seamlessly.

### 3. Automated Merging with Mergify:

Instead of waiting for manual reviews of dependency updates (which can be frequent and minor), Croissant has set rules in Mergify to automatically review and merge these updates. If Dependabot's PR meets the specified criteria, such as passing automated tests, Mergify merges it without manual intervention. This ensures that Croissant’s codebase remains updated and secure without inundating the team with minor reviews, Axolo helping them to focus on reviews that matter.

### 4. Final Merging Phase:

- With all reviews done and dependencies updated, it's time to finalize Hugo’s PR.
- Mergify, with its set rules, verifies if Hugo’s PR fulfills all conditions, such as required approvals and successful test results. On meeting these, Mergify automatically merges the PR, making the process efficient and error-free.
- Axolo archives the pull request channel as a result, letting developers know that this

Through the combined prowess of Axolo and Mergify, Croissant manages to foster a PR process that's not only faster but also ensures higher code quality and security.
