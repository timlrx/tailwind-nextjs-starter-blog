We've categorized the best Slack apps for developers for 2024. Whether you are working in teams or you just want some bots for yourself we've got you covered in this post. While some of the tools in the list are not specific to developers team we listed them because we think they might still be useful for some.

Before you see the list you can also check out our article on the <a target="_blank" href="https://axolo.co/blog/p/top-5-github-pull-request-slack-integration">Top 5 GitHub pull request Slack Integrations</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://axolo.co/blog/p/top-4-github-action-slack-integration"> the Top 4 GitHub Action Slack integrations</a>.

You'll find a table summary at the end of the file.

## Slack apps for productivity

In this category we'll explore the Slack apps we found that can help tech individuals and tech teams be more productive.

### <u>Axolo</u>

Axolo focuses on making it easy for developers to talk about a pull request. The result is that pull requests are resolved faster, it's easier to stay on top of PR and there is an increase in focus due to less context switching. With the whole code review context in Slack, it's easier to get the right people involved in the conversation and to get the right information to make the right decision.

  alt="Axolo Slack App Marketplace Screenshot"
  style={{ width: "500px" }}
/>

#### What we like 👍:

Axolo creates a channel for every pull request and has a deep integration with GitHub & GitLab. It will share the code comments, code reviews, issues, and even the GitHub actions. As a bonus, there is a /lgtm command that lets you approve pull requests in seconds from Slack. You can also easily set up stand-up notifications and code review timeslots to protect your focus time!

More about Axolo: <a target="_blank" href="https://axolo.co">axolo.co</a>.

### <u>Pomodoro tracker</u>

Some people have their pomodoro on their OS but the benefits of having it in Slack is that you can let other people know in your team that you are in a focus mode and that they shouldn't expect you to answer within the next n minutes.

#### What we like 👍:

Simple and powerful. It does what it says it does :).

## Slack project management apps

This category is dedicated to apps that allow you to manage tasks within Slack. Those apps usually allow you to create and assign tasks directly in Slack. It's a crowded space so for brevity we'll just list the one that has been referred to us.

### <u>Linear</u>

Linear defines itself as "The issue tracking tool you'll enjoy using".

<img
  src="https://apichaos.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/LinearSlackAppScreenshot.jpeg"

/>

Linear doesn't have an application listed in the Slack marketplace but you can integrate Slack from your
Linear WorkSpace: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://linear.app/settings/integrations/slack"> Linear</a>.

Linear has a traditional /linear command that allows you to create new issues. Link posted on Slack from linear will be displayed in an organized fashion for people to identify them easily.

#### What we like 👍:

Linear has a way to create a specific channel for a project, sending updates from that project to a channel and making a contextual update on a specific linear project.

### <u>Trello</u>

### <u>Workast</u>

Workast describes itself as "The missing piece of Slack". They seem to be the best-integrated project management app to Slack we've seen so far. They were built around Slack and is fully featured to be workable on Slack.

#### What we like 👍:

Notion started off as a wiki all-in-one workspace for notes and also does collaboration, tables, project management and much more. They have a clean UI/UX and has been around for a few years.

<img
  src="https://apichaos.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/NotionSlackAppscreenshot.png"
  alt="NotionSlackAppscreenshot"
  style={{ width: "500px" }}
/>

The Notion integration allows you to subscribe to changes for a particular page. This is good if you
want to monitor changes in your Notion workspace.{" "}

#### What could be better 😬:

This integration only updates you on changes. Would be interesting to have workflow automation and more actions you could do directly in Slack.

## Standup Slack app bot

Standup meetings are notorious in tech teams, they allow you to stay sync with your team in a (usually) short and efficient way. A standup meeting is usually a time where you share what you've done the day before and what are your plans for the day. It's simple and allows you to share if you need help, and vice versa, see if there is a colleague to who you can give help to.

### <u>Standup.ly</u>

Automate standup meetings, retrospectives, other agile processes and get an internal Q&A system to level up the productivity of your team.

#### What we like 👍:

Standup.ly is more than just a simple standup bot it also allows to have other agile processes with 360 feedback, retrospective meeting, and more.

You can also set it up to get notified of your events coming up during the day.

### <u>Random Slack apps</u>

#### What could be improved 😅

Free trial is only for 14 days and no free version of the product.

### <u>Miro</u>

Miro is a whiteboard collaboration app. Great to brainstorm or even to share ideas with post it or drawings or anything you could do on a white board.
Their slack integrations allows you to Install review comments, find recently updated boards, and approve access requests.

## Incident apps

I’ve seen numerous incident apps coming up in the past few/months/years. They are usually targeted at bigger companies that have SRE (Site reliability engineers) in the company. They are quite useful to put a methodology in place for any tech and non-tech urgency that one company can have.
They usually have a similar process: you have a command you can do from slack /incident create and you need to fill out a form. In the form you put someone in charge, mention the severity and information you can provide to show the problem. It then spins off a channel and you can discuss how to best resolve it with the right team and people who are automatically invited to that channel.

### <u>Incident.io</u>

Incident.io is a well-funded company by ex-Monzo (banking) employees. They have a 250+ people community in Slack and seem to have happy customers. I’ve seen screenshots of recap of incidents and it looks nice!

<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://incident.io/">

### <u>Allma.io</u>
