## Overview of the official GitHub Slack integration

The official GitHub Slack integration is a basic tool that allows users to receive notifications about activity on their GitHub repositories directly in Slack. Some of its key features include:

- the ability to receive notifications for pull requests, issues, and code reviews,
- as well as the ability to link to specific GitHub issues or pull requests from within Slack.

To use the integration, you must first link you GitHub account to your Slack workspace. Once linked, the integration can be configured to send notifications for a variety of events, including pull requests, issues, code reviews, and more. You can choose which repositories you want to receive notifications for, as well as which channels in Slack should receive the notifications.

When a notification is triggered, a message is sent to the designated Slack channel, which includes a link to the corresponding GitHub issue, pull request, or other event. You can then click on the link to be taken directly to the relevant item in GitHub, where they can view additional details and take any necessary actions.

## Limitations of the official GitHub Slack integration

While the official GitHub Slack integration provides some basic functionality for integrating GitHub with Slack, it has several limitations. They are mainly two areas where the GitHub Slack integration is limited:

- Limited customization options: The official GitHub Slack integration offers limited customization options, which can make it difficult to tailor notifications to specific use cases.
- Limited functionality: While the integration can provide basic notifications for pull requests, issues, and other events, it doesn't offer much functionality beyond that.

These limitations have detrimental effects on your team's focus because:

1. each engineer is notified of its own actions, instead of warning only the rest of the team,
2. the whole team is alerted for each action, instead of only the relevant people only,
3. it's hard to keep track of important actions, because of the noise,
4. it's impossible to have a conversation in the GitHub channel because of the constant notifications, and it creates a lot of context-switching because Slack comments are not propagated to GitHub.

So while the official GitHub Slack integration can be useful for some basic use cases, it's not a good fit for teams that want to customize their notifications or take advantage of more advanced features. If you want to improve your developer workflow and boost your team's productivity, you'll need a more customizable and feature-rich solution, and have two choices: either [create your own application](http://axolo.co/blog/p/create-your-first-github-bot) or use a third-party tool like Axolo.
