## The Problem Stated by RichardNias:

"Apologies first of all if this issue already exists. And also thanks for this integration, really enjoying it so far.

I think it would be quire nice if we could configure which pull request events we can subscribe to. Something like:

pulls:all - Opened, closed and merged PRs
pulls:new - Opened PRs
pulls:closed - Closed PRs
pulls:merged - Merged PRs
pulls - same as pulls:all, default (keeping current behaviour).
The use case for this is we have a channel where we like to post PRs that are ready for review, but is mainly used as a discussion channel which we don't want to be full of unneeded messages. We have another channel where we subscribe to all activity for reference.

I'm happy to give this a go, will look at opening a PR in the next few days unless someone is already working on something similar."

## Problem Identified with this Issue:

1. It's hard to know what is the state of a pull request.
2. Notification clutter leading to a disorganized Slack workspace and decreased team engagement.

## 1 Channel, 1 State: Proposed Solution by RichardNias

RichardNias proposes creating separate Slack channels for different states of pull requests, such as:

- `#merged-pull-requests`
- `#closed-pull-requests`
- `#new-pull-requests`

## Updated Notifications and 1 Channel per Pull Request: Proposed Solution by Axolo

Axolo addresses this issue in a three-fold manner:

1.  A general channel notifies the team about new pull requests.

        {" "}

        <ImageContainer
          alt="notifications status"
          src="/blog/static/images/notifications/notifications status.jpg"
          classNameDiv="mx-10 lg:mx-20"
          classNameImage=""
          width={3266}
          height={1962}
        />

              <SubImageText classNameDiv="" classNameText="lg:w-80 ">

        In this screenshot you can see new pull request create a notification. Then this notification is automatically updated with

    1)The status of the pull request (open, closed, merged, draft, waiting for review, WIP) and 2) The
    status of the reviewers and assignees

            </SubImageText>

1.  Real-time updates are provided for each pull request, indicating its current status—be it WIP, waiting for review, draft, merged, or closed.
1.  A dedicated Slack channel is created for each pull request, involving only the relevant engineers—assignees, creators, and reviewers—for focused discussion and updates.
    <ImageContainer
      alt="1 channel 1 pr"
      src="/blog/static/images/notifications/channel-pr.jpg"
      classNameDiv="mx-10 lg:mx-20"
      classNameImage=""
      width={2936}
      height={2112}
    />
    <SubImageText classNameDiv="" classNameText="lg:w-80 ">
      Each pull request creates a channel. Reviewers are automatically invited and all the
      discussions is mirrored from Slack to GitHub and vice versa. You'll also find all relevant
      information about your PR (CI/CD etc..)
