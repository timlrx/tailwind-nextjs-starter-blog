## ✨ New

- new notification in channel if someone pushed new commits in an already approved PR,
- release of the GitLab integration and updated our onbaording accordingly
- possibility to change the number of reviewers maximum to invite while inviting a team as a reviewer on GitHub (default: 4)

## 🔨 Improvements

- do not archive a team-specific channel if it was not created by Axolo
- added a warning in the Axolo home if the engineer is not fully onboarded
- ability to prevent engineers from onboarding by themselves on the Axolo home
- using the engineer's GitHub oAuth to delete comments in GitHub

## 🐞 Fixes

- PR reminders were not working for incomplete engineers' Slack profiles
- incoming webhook optimization
