By adhering to best practices for writing Git commit messages, developers can enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of their project workflows, ensuring that the version control history is a valuable resource for everyone involved in the project.

## Part 1: Understanding Git Commit Messages

### What is a Git Commit Message?

A Git commit message is a brief text that accompanies each commit in a Git repository. It provides a snapshot of what changes were made and why, serving as an essential piece of documentation within the version control system.

- **Definition and Purpose**: A Git commit message serves to explain the context and intent of the changes made in a particular commit. This makes it easier for other developers (and your future self) to understand the rationale behind changes when reviewing the project history.
  - [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit)
- **Anatomy of a Commit Message**: A well-structured commit message typically consists of a subject line, a body, and a footer. The subject line is a brief summary of the changes, the body provides more detailed information, and the footer includes any relevant metadata, such as issue references.
  - [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

### Why Git Commit Messages Matter

Beyond their role in basic project management, Git commit messages play several critical roles in the development lifecycle and overall project health.

- **Facilitating Code Reviews**: Clear commit messages make it easier for reviewers to understand the scope and purpose of changes. This leads to more effective and efficient code reviews.
  - [The Importance of Commit Messages](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/git-commit-message-5e21)
- **Debugging and Troubleshooting**: When bugs arise, a well-documented commit history allows developers to trace changes that might have introduced issues. This can significantly speed up the debugging process.
- **Project Onboarding**: For new team members, commit messages provide valuable insights into the project's evolution and decision-making processes, easing the onboarding process.
- **Automating Workflows**: Many CI/CD systems and release tools use commit messages to trigger actions, generate changelogs, and automate parts of the deployment process. Consistent messaging ensures these tools work effectively.
- **Historical Context**: Over time, commit messages build a historical narrative of the project. This context is invaluable for understanding why certain decisions were made, especially in complex projects.

By consistently writing informative commit messages, developers can ensure that the version control history remains a valuable resource for everyone involved in the project.

## Part 2: Structure of a Git Commit Message

### Subject Line

The subject line is the first part of a commit message and should provide a brief summary of the changes made. It sets the tone for the rest of the message and helps reviewers quickly understand the purpose of the commit.

- **Brief Summary of the Commit (50 characters max)**: The subject line should be concise, ideally limited to 50 characters, to ensure readability in various Git tools and interfaces.
  - [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

### Body

The body of a commit message provides detailed information about the changes made. It explains the "what" and "why" behind the changes, offering valuable context for reviewers and future maintainers.

- **Detailed Explanation of What and Why**: The body should elaborate on the changes introduced by the commit, explaining what was done and why it was necessary. This section can include technical details, design decisions, and any relevant background information.
  - [Writing Good Commit Messages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/writing-good-commit-messages-a-practical-guide/)
- **Reference to Relevant Issues or Pull Requests**: Whenever possible, include references to related issues or pull requests. This helps link the commit to broader project discussions and provides additional context.
  - [Referencing Issues in Commits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls)
- **Separate Paragraphs for Different Points**: To enhance readability, separate different points or topics within the body into distinct paragraphs. This makes the message easier to scan and understand.
  - [Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format)

### Footer

The footer of a commit message includes additional metadata that may be relevant to the commit. This can include co-authors, issue tracking information, and other pertinent details.

- **Metadata Like Co-Authors, Issue Tracking, etc.**: The footer can be used to acknowledge co-authors, track related issues, or include other relevant metadata. This helps maintain a clear and comprehensive record of contributions.
  - [Sign-off in Commit Messages](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--s)
- **Sign-off Details**: When required, include a "Signed-off-by" line in the footer to indicate who authored or reviewed the commit. This is particularly useful in projects that follow the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

  height={1252}
/>

Writing great commit messages is an art that combines clarity, brevity, and structure. Here are some best practices to follow, ensuring your commit messages are both informative and efficient.

### Keep Messages Short but Descriptive

Your commit message should be concise yet descriptive enough to convey the main change. Aim for subject lines under 50 characters and body text that provides necessary details without being overly verbose.

- **Optimal Length for Subject Lines and Bodies**: Keep your subject line to 50 characters or less to ensure it fits nicely in various Git tools and interfaces.
  - [Git Commit Message Length](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#limit-50)

### Separate Subject and Body with a Blank Line

Always separate the subject from the body with a blank line. This enhances readability and ensures that tools parsing your commits can do so accurately.

### Use the Body to Explain What and Why, Not How

The body of your commit message should focus on what changes were made and why they were necessary, not on how the changes were implemented. This keeps the message concise and focused.

### Reference Issues and Pull Requests

Linking to relevant issues or pull requests provides context and helps trace the history of the changes. It’s a good practice to reference issues directly in the commit message.

- **Linking to GitHub or GitLab Issues**: Use autolinked references to connect your commits to issues and PRs.
  - [GitHub Autolinked References](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls)

### Capitalize the Subject Line

Always start the subject line with a capital letter. This is a simple yet effective way to keep your commit messages looking professional and consistent.

### Do Not End the Subject Line with a Period

Avoid ending the subject line with a period. It’s unnecessary and goes against the convention of keeping the subject line brief and to the point.

### Wrap the Body at 72 Characters

For better readability, wrap the body text at 72 characters. This makes your commit message easier to read in various interfaces, especially those that display text in a narrow column.

### Examples of Good vs. Bad Commit Messages

Seeing examples can help you understand these best practices in action. Here are some comparisons to illustrate good and bad commit messages.

- **Good Commit Messages**: Clear, concise, and informative.

  - **Example 1:**

    ```plaintext
