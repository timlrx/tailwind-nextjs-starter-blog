Looking to create your coding style documentation? You're at the right place! Crafting a clear and consistent coding style guide is essential for maintaining code quality, ensuring team collaboration, and facilitating smoother onboarding for new team members. This guide will walk you through the key components of a robust coding style documentation, from project structure to deprecated code management. By addressing the questions asked under each section, you'll be well on your way to establishing a strong foundation for your engineering team's coding practices.

You can start simple with only a few sections, but if you answer everything, you should have a great start, let's dive in!

<YellowCalloutBox emoji="⚠️" title="Limitations">
  While ChatGPT is a powerful tool, developers should be aware of its limitations. Over-relying on
  its suggestions without understanding the reasoning can lead to sub-optimal code. It's vital to
  ensure human oversight in the development process. It doesn't always understand context in the way
  a human does. For instance, in complex projects where there are multiple intertwined systems, a
  solution that might seem apt in isolation might not be the best fit for the broader system.
