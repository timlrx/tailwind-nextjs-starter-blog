## Introduction to the developer experience survey

This article aims to help companies who want to survey their engineers to improve the developer experience in their engineering team. We developed this survey upon the recommendations of the [SPACE framework](https://axolo.co/blog/p/developer-productivity), the [four key DevOps metrics from Accelerate](https://axolo.co/blog/p/accelerate-four-key-devops-metrics), and our own experience working with engineering teams through [Axolo](https://axolo.co).

To make a summary of all the important aspects to take into account according to the SPACE framework, you can also find and download our _Engineering productivity cheatsheet_ below:

We separated this survey into 4 topics, where you can easily add or remove any question. They are:

- **Code Review**: code review process, quality of the code delivered, quality of feedback, code review pace
- **Engineering system**: use of continuous integration, degree of infrastructure satisfaction, deployment frequency, meetings, documentation,
- **Testing**: local and CI execution environment, test types used (UI or unit)
- **Company Organization**: level of happiness, coordination, remote work, synchronization, communication tools, future developments

> Note from the authors: This survey should be completely anonymous. You should save each answer indepently and not in thread to prevent managers from finding who is the employee by finding out one answer.
