Slack has created the Future of Work program, an incubator aimed at supporting French startups in the field. The program is designed to assist entrepreneurs as they navigate the changing world of work and aims to help them grow their businesses by addressing various key areas, including work-life balance, company culture, communication, automation, talent recruitment and management, and retention.

Slack and Station F hope that this program will help to establish a French ecosystem of startups that can complement Slack's offerings and drive innovation in the Future of Work industry.

For years, Slack has been a trailblazer in tackling work-related challenges and a leading figure in
the Future of Work movement. The company is credited with numerous advancements in the field,
particularly in terms of communication, and has been one of the first to share its insights through
the Slack Future Forum.

The <NoFollowLink url="https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/transformation/roadmap-for-the-future-of-work">
Future of Work</NoFollowLink> program from Slack is a key component of the company's larger and more comprehensive
project, the roadmap for the Future of Work, which was released in June 2021 and embodies Slack's core
values on the work experience.

That's why we are thrilled to have been selected as one of the six companies incubated by the Slack's Future of Work program. We have been loving working on Slack for the past few years and are excited to be able to continue to do so, with their help!

We are also thrilled to be part of the Station F ecosystem, which is one of the largest startup hubs in the world. Station F is a 100,000 square meter campus in Paris, France, that houses over 1,000 startups and 10,000 entrepreneurs. It is also home to the largest startup incubator in the world, Station F Accelerator, which has helped to launch over 1,000 startups since its inception in 2017.

We are looking forward to working with Slack and Station F to help shape the Future of Work and to continue to build a better workplace for everyone.
