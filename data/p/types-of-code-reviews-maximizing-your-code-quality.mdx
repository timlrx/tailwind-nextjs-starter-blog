### Pull Requests for Change-Based Code Review

**Pull requests** are one of the most widely used methods for [code reviews](https://axolo.co) in modern development environments, especially in Git-based workflows. In this approach, developers submit a pull request (PR) to propose changes to a codebase. Other team members then review the code, leaving comments and suggesting improvements before the changes are merged into the main branch.

Pull request reviews are tightly integrated with version control systems like **GitHub** and are often supported by **code review software** that facilitates inline comments and discussions. This method is particularly useful for ensuring that all changes are thoroughly reviewed before being merged, making it popular in both open-source and corporate development teams.

### Stacked Pull Requests: An Improved Way to Do Pull Request Code Reviews

**Stacked pull requests** are an advanced technique used to manage large or complex code changes by breaking them into smaller, more manageable pull requests. Instead of submitting one massive pull request with numerous changes, developers create a series of smaller, "stacked" pull requests that build on each other. Each pull request is reviewed and merged sequentially, making the review process more digestible and reducing the risk of errors.

This approach allows teams to handle interdependent changes more efficiently, particularly in fast-moving projects where continuous integration is key. Stacked pull requests also help maintain a clean and organized commit history, improving overall project maintainability.

**Advantages of Stacked Pull Requests:**

- **Easier to review**: Breaking large changes into smaller, independent pull requests reduces the cognitive load on reviewers, leading to more thorough reviews.
- **Improved feedback**: Reviewers can provide more focused feedback on smaller sections of code, making the review process more effective.
- **Faster merging**: Smaller pull requests can be merged more quickly, keeping the project moving forward without waiting for one large review to complete.

**Disadvantages of Stacked Pull Requests:**

- **Requires careful management**: Mismanaging the order of pull requests can lead to confusion or integration issues, especially if changes are dependent on one another.
- **Complexity for new developers**: Stacked pull requests can be confusing for team members unfamiliar with the process, requiring extra onboarding and guidance.
- **Potential for merge conflicts**: Handling multiple pull requests in sequence increases the chances of encountering merge conflicts that need to be resolved manually.

By using **stacked pull requests**, teams can streamline the code review process, making it easier to manage complex changes. This technique is especially useful for larger teams or projects that require **continuous integration** and rapid iterations.
