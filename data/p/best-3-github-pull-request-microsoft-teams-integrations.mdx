## **1. Axolo**

Focusing on collaboration across the whole engineering team, Axolo is not another pull request notification bot. It's been designed to engage about code easily and resolve pull requests in the most efficient way possible.

### 😍 What we like:

Axolo makes a temporary Teams channel for every GitHub pull request, it will invite reviewers and assignees to the channel, notify them of relevant events like code comments, comments, GitHub actions, deployments and finally it will archive the channel once you close or merge pull request.

  />
</div>

Axolo is currently in private early-access for Microsoft Teams at the moment. Tell us <a onClick={() => { window.$crisp.push(['do', 'chat:open']); window.$crisp.push(["do", "message:send", ["text", "Hey, I want to try the Axolo Microsoft teams integration!"]]); window.$crisp.push(["set", "session:event", ["microsoft_request"]]) }}>here</a> if you would like to take part in the early-access with your email and we will get back to you.

<button
  onClick={() => {
    window.$crisp.push(["do", "chat:open"])
    window.$crisp.push([
      "do",
      "message:send",
      ["text", "Hey, I want to try the Axolo Microsoft teams integration!"],
    ])
    window.$crisp.push(["set", "session:event", ["microsoft_request"]])
  }}
  style={{
    backgroundColor: "blue",
    border: "none",
    color: "white",
    fontWeight: 600,
    padding: "15px 32px",
    textAlign: "center",
    textDecoration: "none",
    display: "inline-block",
    fontSize: 16,
  }}
>
  Request Axolo early access
</button>

## **2. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/integrations/microsoft-teams">Official GitHub Microsoft integrations</a>.**

Since this is an official integration there are cool features you will not see in another type of reminder bots, such as displaying code directly in Teams.

### 😍 What we like:

Code can be displayed directly in Teams.
It's highly customizable, you have to choose which repository you want to subscribe to, deactivate some notifications. The integration is well documented.
It's also maintained by the GitHub team, and if you have questions you might be able to ask them directly.

### 🤔 What we don't like:

It takes time to set it up and can be confusing as well.
In order to have it work, you will need to subscribe manually to each of the repositories using Teams slash commands.

## **3. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://automate.io/integration/github/microsoft-teams">Automate.io</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://zapier.com/apps/github/integrations/microsoft-teams">Zapier</a>**

### 😍 What we like:

It's easy to set up custom workflow for individuals or for a specific channel, especially if you already have Zapier / or [Automate.io](http://Automate.io).

### 🤔 What we don't like:

The lack of GitHub actions and deployments notifications.
Also the integration are basic and probably won't be enough to fit all your needs.

# Conclusion

We looked at 3 different GitHub and Teams integrations. Those 3 integrations take a different approach in trying to make pull requests last shorter and more engaging.

We see two types of GitHub and Teams integrations:

## 1. The one that are simple notifications based on events:

Those bots, like Zapier, the official GitHub Teams integration will notify either you personally or a channel that a Pull Request is ready to be reviewed.

## 2. The truly collaborative apps:

Axolo is the best in this category. On top of enabling the right notifications (like CI/CD, GitHub actions, deployment and checks), Axolo creates contextual channels for each Pull Request.

Companies that use Axolo found that creating those spaces to talk about a specific pull request makes it easier to collaborate during code reviews and resolve pull requests quickly.

Let us know <a onClick={() => { window.$crisp.push(['do', 'chat:open']); window.$crisp.push(["do", "message:send", ["text", "Hey, I want to try the Axolo Microsoft teams integration!"]]) }}>here</a> if you want to try out the Axolo GitHub Microsoft Teams integration.
