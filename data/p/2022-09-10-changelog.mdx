- Ask Axolo to send you a PR summary with the /axolo command.
  1. `/axolo open` to show all open PRs of your organization,
  2. `/axolo me` for your open PRs,
  3. `/axolo team [specific-team]` to show all PRs from a specific team.

## 🔨 Improvements

- For team channels: you can choose to deactivate Axolo or archive the channel altogether.
- Added emoji for the check bookmark (✅❌🔄).
- Creating a new view for Axolo Home in Slack and for the /axolo command used by organizations with private PR channels (using PR titles instead of Slack channel links).

## 🐞 Fixes

- Reviewers were not invited when using the manual open channel tool from app.axolo.co.
- Gitlab: allows import of teams from subgroups. This enables GitLab users to have team channels.
- GitHub code snippets were a bit out of hand, it’s now showing the correct code location.
- Solved a bug where the GitLab OAuth was being updated on the organization and not on the admin user. This would cause Axolo not to archive channels or sometimes not create any.
- On GitHub, pasted images from code review comments weren’t showing nicely on Slack, this has been resolved, thanks to Adar.
- Solved an error where Axolo was mixing two pull requests from different repositories of the same organization because of identical branch names.
- Solved an error that prevented PR checks to be sent to specific organizations.

## 📖 Documentation

- Added GitLab to our documentation.
- Changed the Setting section architecture completely to follow the app settings.
