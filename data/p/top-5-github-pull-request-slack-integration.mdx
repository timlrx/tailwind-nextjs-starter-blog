## Why does integrating GitHub with Slack matter?

Let's be honest—constantly switching between GitHub and Slack can disrupt your workflow. Every time you leave your code to check on pull requests or updates, it breaks your concentration. Integrating GitHub with Slack brings your code discussions right into your team conversations. With real-time notifications for pull requests, code reviews, and issues right in Slack, you won't have to keep switching tabs. It's not just handy; it transforms how we collaborate. Everyone stays updated instantly, so your team can spot bugs faster, give quick feedback, and keep projects on track. It makes the development process smoother and more connected.

## We've compared the top 5 Github Slack integrations in 2025

Handling code reviews and pull requests can sometimes feel like you're juggling too many balls at once. Especially now, with remote work being the new normal, having a smooth process is more crucial than ever. That's where GitHub Slack integrations step in to save the day.

You might already use the official GitHub Slack integration, but did you know there are several other options that offer unique features to boost your team's productivity? In this article, we're going to dive into the top 5 GitHub Slack integrations that can truly change the way your engineering team collaborates.

From getting real-time notifications to setting up dedicated Slack channels for each pull request, these integrations come packed with features tailored to different team needs. So, let's jump in and find the perfect GitHub Slack integration for your team!

## **1. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://github.com/integrations/slack">Official GitHub Slack integrations</a>.**

Since this is an official integration there are cool features you will not see in another type of reminder bots, such as displaying code directly in Slack.

### 😍 What we like:

Code can be displayed directly in Slack.
It's highly customizable, you can choose which repository you can subscribe to, deactivate some notifications. The integration is well documented.
It's also maintained by the GitHub team, and if you have questions you might be able to ask them directly.

Axolo has more than 1k installations on the official GitHub marketplace and offers a free tier.

### 🤔 What we don't like:

It takes time to set it up and can be confusing as well.
In order to have it work, you will need to subscribe manually to each of the repositories using Slack slash commands.

Focusing on collaboration across the whole engineering team, Axolo is not another pull request notification bot. It is engineered to optimize code review and streamline the pull request resolution process by fostering collaboration across the entire engineering team. The platform is designed to enable seamless discussions about code, ensuring that all team members have access to the information and tools they need to resolve pull requests efficiently.

### 😍 What we like:

Axolo makes a temporary Slack channel for every GitHub pull request, it will invite reviewers and assignees to the channel, notify them of relevant events like code comments, comments, GitHub Actions, Deployments and finally it will archive the channel once you close or merge pull request.

### 🤔 Improvements:

Some teams have shared that it used to be too noisy. The Axolo team introduced code reviewing timeslots in September 2021. Developers can choose the time in the day when they want to be invited to review a new pull request. It's a good way to keep the focus on coding and having dedicated time for code reviews during the day.

## **3. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://toast.ninja/">Toast.Ninja</a>**

### 😍 What we like:

They have a enterprise version for GitHub enterprise.
It feels like the founders spend a lot of time making it fully integrated into Slack. For example, the onboarding process is well integrated into Slack, where you can choose different options without leaving the app.

They recently added analytics that are sent directly into Slack as well.

### 🤔 What we don't like:

The lack of GitHub actions and deployments notifications. We didn't find any collaborative aspect to this app. It could easily be used by just one person in the team.

Toast is not visible on the GitHub marketplace.

## 6. Case Study on GitHub-Slack integration: Agency Analytics - How Axolo reduced PR cycle time by 65%

<TopGuestBanner
  text="Blake Acheson is the CTO and cofounder of Agency Analytics. He's been using Axolo for a year. We sat down with him to discuss how Axolo has improved their code review process and reduced their pull request cycle time by 65%."
  imageUrl="/blog/static/images/agencyanalytics/blake-acheson.webp"
/>

#### Before Axolo:

The team at Agency Analytics was struggling with GitHub's inefficient code review process and unintuitive notification system. They faced issues like slow pickup times, elongated pull request review cycles, and generally inefficient workflow.

#### The Transition to Axolo:

Initially tested with one team, Axolo soon proved itself indispensable, making the code review process more efficient and streamlined. The integration of Slack and Axolo facilitated open communication, transforming their trunk-based development approach.

<Callout

## What are the benefits of GitHub Slack integration?

Imagine you're deep in the zone, writing code that's going to change the world—or at least fix that one annoying bug—and then you have to stop to check GitHub for a pull request. Context-switching is the top enemy of productivity for developers. Integrating GitHub with Slack keeps you in the loop without breaking your flow.

Here's why GitHub Slack integration is a game-changer for developers:

- Real-Time Notifications: Get instant updates on pull requests, code reviews, and issues directly in Slack. No more refreshing GitHub pages.
- Reduced Context Switching: Stay focused on your code. Important GitHub events come to you in Slack, so you don't have to juggle multiple platforms.
- Streamlined Code Reviews: Discuss code snippets and review comments right within Slack channels or threads. Keep the conversation and the code together.
- Faster Collaboration: Quickly loop in team members by mentioning them in Slack, accelerating problem-solving and decision-making.
- Automated Workflows: Approve pull requests, merge code, or trigger CI/CD pipelines from Slack commands. Automate repetitive tasks to save time.
- Enhanced Visibility: Keep track of project progress with Slack notifications about deployments, builds, and test results.
- Customized Alerts: Tailor notifications to your needs. Subscribe to specific repositories or mute less critical updates.

By bringing GitHub into Slack, you create a centralized hub for both communication and code collaboration. This integration not only boosts your productivity but also enhances team synergy, making the development process more efficient and enjoyable.

## Conclusion

We looked at 5 different GitHub and Slack integrations. Those 5 integrations take a different approach in trying to make pull requests last shorter.

We see two types of GitHub and Slack integrations:

### 1. The one that are simple notifications based on events:

Those bots, like Toast.ninja, the official GitHub Slack integration will notify either you personally or a channel that a Pull Request is ready to be reviewed.

#### Downside:

One place for all pull requests notifications is good for smaller teams but can become a nightmare for larger teams. It can easily be ignored after a while.

### 2. The truly collaborative apps:

Axolo is the best in this category. On top of enabling the right notifications (like CI/CD, GitHub actions, deployment and checks), Axolo creates contextual channels for each Pull Request.

Companies that use Axolo found that creating those spaces to talk about a specific pull request makes it easier to collaborate during code reviews, impove the developer experience and resolve pull requests quickly.
