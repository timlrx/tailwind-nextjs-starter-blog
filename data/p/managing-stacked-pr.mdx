## 1. What is a Stacked PR? A Strategy for Sequential and Manageable Code Reviews

  The image contrasts two approaches to software development. On the left, a team works together
  smoothly, each piece of their puzzle represents a small, easy-to-manage pull request, symbolizing
  efficient collaboration and clear progress. On the right, a developer is overwhelmed by a jumble
  of puzzle pieces, illustrating the confusion and complexity of handling a large, unwieldy pull
  request. This visual metaphor highlights the advantages of stacked pull requests: quicker reviews,
  fewer bugs, and a more organized codebase.

A Stacked Pull Request (PR) is a development workflow strategy where multiple smaller PRs are opened in a specific sequence, each one building upon the previous. This approach allows for easier code review, as each PR contains a manageable chunk of changes, making it simpler for reviewers to understand the context and impact. Stacked PRs are particularly useful in larger projects where a single PR could become overwhelming to review.

## 2. The Importance of Stacked PRs in Streamlined Code Reviews

Stacked PRs align well with the best practices of having small, manageable changes in each pull request, as advocated by [Google's engineering practices](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html). Here are some key reasons why this is important:

- **Quick Reviews**: Smaller PRs are reviewed more quickly, making it easier for both developers and reviewers to allocate time.
- **Thorough Reviews**: The limited scope of smaller PRs allows for more thorough and focused code reviews, reducing the chances of overlooking critical issues.
- **Reduced Bug Risk**: With fewer changes to consider, it's easier to assess the impact of the code, thereby minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.
- **Less Wasted Work**: In case a PR is rejected, smaller changes result in less wasted effort on both sides.
- **Easier Merging**: Smaller PRs are less likely to result in merge conflicts, simplifying the integration process.
- **Better Design**: The manageable size of small PRs makes it easier to maintain good design and code health.
- **Unblocked Progress**: The self-contained nature of small PRs allows developers to continue working on other tasks while awaiting reviews.

By aligning with the principle of making small, focused changes, Stacked PRs inherently incorporate these best practices into your development workflow.

  Managing Stacked PR as a developer
</SubImageText>

Managing Stacked PRs in GitHub can be a game-changer for your development workflow. According to a [LogRocket blog post](https://blog.logrocket.com/using-stacked-pull-requests-in-github/), here's a simplified guide on how to manage Stacked PRs in GitHub:

### Creating a Stacked PR

1. **Checkout the Base Branch**: Start by checking out the base branch, usually `master` or `develop`.
   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git checkout -b feature-branch
   ```
2. **Make Changes and Commit**: Make your changes and commit them.
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt
   git add hello.txt
   git commit -m 'Add hello.txt'
   ```
3. **Push and Create PR**: Push the changes and create a PR against the base branch.
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-branch
   ```

### Creating a Dependent PR

1. **Checkout the First Branch**: Make sure you are on the first branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   git checkout -b feature-branch-2
   ```
2. **Make Changes and Commit**: Make additional changes and commit them.
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, again!" > hello2.txt
   git add hello2.txt
   git commit -m 'Add hello2.txt'
   ```
3. **Push and Create PR**: Push the changes and create a PR. This PR will be dependent on the first one.
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature-branch-2
   ```

### Merging Stacked PRs

- **Direct Merge**: Use the "Merge" option to maintain the commit history.

### Best Practices

- **Labeling**: Label the PR as 'Stacked' to avoid confusion.
- **Order of Merging**: Merge the base PR first to simplify subsequent merges.

By following these simplified steps, you can manage Stacked PRs in GitHub more effectively, making your development process more organized and efficient.
