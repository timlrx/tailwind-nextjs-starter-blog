## 1. Introduction to Slack and GitHub Integration

<TOCInline toc={props.toc} toHeading={4} asDisclosure />

### 1.1 What is Slack?

If you're on this page, it's safe to say you're probably not a stranger to Slack. However, let's ensure everyone is on the same level and start with the basics.

According to a <NoFollowLink url="https://www.businessinsider.com/where-did-slack-get-its-name-2016-9?r=US&IR=T#:~:text=In%20a%20Twitter%20thread%20from,of%20All%20Conversation%20and%20Knowledge.%22">Business Insider article</NoFollowLink>, Slack stands for 'Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge.' It's an enterprise software platform that was first introduced to the world in 2013 by Stewart Butterfield, Eric Costello, Cal Henderson, and Serguei Mourachov.

Interestingly, the journey of Slack is intertwined with a gaming company. <NoFollowLink url="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/the-slack-origin-story/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL-IdxmGuwrQtLal33eG33j7JHOA0q4rrPZZCgOQbldqVUC3gMe2zM5cUH4bcqHqePxLBmk85KlV-tnILz0i0lzT9tZCsgRERuEew1duVZhjVQzosK_7SXBA8sryjKwftCX4Z3e6QkhiaN7Q6K4axY1LnNVVrDDDhGd4Eqff8jXC">TechCrunch's article</NoFollowLink> narrates how Slack was originally a communication tool developed for a team working on an online game named 'Glitch.' When the game failed to make a mark, the team realized the tool they'd developed had a much broader appeal and could meet the communication needs of teams worldwide. Thus, Slack, as we know it, was born.

/>{" "}

According to Cal (CTO of Slack), Slack was initially designed for teams of 5 to 50 people maximum. It quickly spread and team that were much bigger asked to use the platform, they had to spend a significant amount of time redesigning their software just to accept larger teams.

Fast forward to the present day, and Slack is no longer just a messaging platform. It's a comprehensive ecosystem for integrations, with the ability to consolidate numerous services — from GitHub to Google Drive to Trello, and so much more, as outlined on the <NoFollowLink url="https://slack.com/apps">Slack's official apps </NoFollowLink>page. For developers, Slack is an invaluable tool, transforming casual chats into productive development discussions, complete with code snippets, issue tracking, and even executing commands via Slack apps.

In essence, Slack is far more than a platform for chatting. It's a central hub designed to streamline your development workflow. And if you didn't know what Slack was... well, we promise we won't spill the beans to your fellow developers.

### 1.2 What is GitHub?

There are very high changes you also know what GitHub is. But let's take this opportunity to give you some fun facts and history about GitHub.
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It's the haven where developers store their projects and network with like minds. (<NoFollowLink url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">Source Wikipedia</NoFollowLink>)

Launched in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner, Chris Wanstrath, and PJ Hyett, GitHub was not just another project hosting service. It was conceived with a mission to simplify collaboration among developers, foster innovation, and create a platform where developers could showcase their work to the world.

The inception of GitHub ushered in a new era of social coding. It transformed Git, a powerful but complex command-line tool, into a user-friendly platform that enabled developers to collaborate on projects irrespective of their geographical location.

With its commitment to fostering open-source projects, GitHub quickly became a popular platform among developers. Over time, it has grown into a vast repository of code with contributions from millions of users worldwide.

And here's an interesting tidbit: The octocat, GitHub's adorable mascot, was selected via a Twitter logo contest. A graphic designer named Simon Oxley submitted the winning design, which has since become one of the most recognizable symbols in the developer community. <NoFollowLink url="https://www.mend.io/blog/the-hidden-stories-behind-the-open-source-logos-we-all-love/">"The hidden stories behind the open-source logos we all love." Mend.io</NoFollowLink>

  height={2500}
/>

In a nutshell, GitHub is more than just a website for hosting code. It's a platform where developers learn, collaborate, contribute, and shape the future of software. And if you weren't quite familiar with GitHub before... well, we hope this makes up for lost time!"

</div>

We wrote a detailed guide on 4 differents ways to subscribe to pull requests here: [Github: 4 ways to subscribe to pull requests](https://axolo.co/blog/p/Github-4-ways-to-subscribe-to-pull-requests).

Below is a simpliest way to configure but you'll find the official documentation here: [Official GitHub Slack documentation](https://github.com/integrations/slack#installing-the-github-integration-for-slack).

Once you've installed the GitHub app on your Slack workspace, you'll need to configure the integration settings.

1. **Connect a GitHub repository to a Slack channel**: To connect a repository with a channel, go to the channel and type `/github subscribe [owner]/[repo]`, replacing `[owner]` and `[repo]` with the owner's username and the repository name respectively.
2. **Set up notifications**: You can customize what notifications you receive in Slack by typing `/github subscribe [owner]/[repo] [feature]`, where `[feature]` is the type of notification like issues, pulls, etc.
3. **Link GitHub and Slack accounts**: To link your GitHub and Slack accounts, type `/github signin` in Slack.

Remember, all these commands should be typed directly in the message box in your Slack channel.

With this setup complete, you're ready to start harnessing the power of the Slack and GitHub integration!

## 3. Exploring Collaboration Features: A Deep Dive into GitHub and Slack Integration

### 3.1 Understanding Notifications and Activity Feeds

One of the key benefits of the Slack and GitHub integration is the ability to receive real-time notifications about various GitHub activities. These notifications can be customized to include various activities like commits, pull requests, and issues. Activity feeds provide a comprehensive view of repository activity, allowing your team to stay up-to-date without having to leave Slack.

### 3.2 Strategy for Creating and Managing Slack Channels for Different Repositories

A recommended strategy for managing GitHub notifications in Slack is to create individual Slack channels for different repositories. This way, team members can join channels relevant to their work, reducing notification noise and improving focus. Commands like `/github subscribe [owner]/[repo]` can be used to link a GitHub repository to a specific Slack channel.

### 3.3 Methodology to Link Pull Requests and Issues to Slack Conversations

You can discuss GitHub pull requests and issues directly in Slack. When a new pull request or issue is created, a notification is sent to the linked Slack channel. These notifications include a link that allows you to view the issue or pull request in GitHub. By clicking on 'Open in GitHub', you can seamlessly move to GitHub for more detailed actions or view, keeping the conversation flowing in Slack.

### 3.4 Deep Dive into Commit Messages and Their Implications

Commit messages are crucial for understanding code changes in any development workflow. With Slack and GitHub integration, commit messages are shared in the linked Slack channel. These messages include the commit author, the files changed, and the commit message, providing context and clarity about each change made.

### 3.5 A Comprehensive Guide to Managing GitHub Actions with Slack

GitHub Actions help automate software workflows. By integrating GitHub Actions with Slack, you can receive notifications about the status of your actions, monitor workflows, and quickly react if something goes wrong. For instance, you can get notified when a build fails or when a new deployment is initiated, all within your Slack channels.

We wrote a detailed guide on how to use Slack with GitHub Actions here: [How to use Slack with GitHub Actions](https://axolo.co/blog/p/top-4-github-action-slack-integration).

### 3.6 Harnessing the Power of Slack Commands for GitHub Actions

Slack commands are a powerful tool for managing GitHub Actions. You can use commands like `/github run [workflow]` to manually trigger a GitHub Action. By harnessing these commands, you can automate workflows directly from Slack, further enhancing productivity and efficiency.

### 3.7 Tracking Your Build's Progress: A Look at Deployment Status on Slack

Keeping track of your build's progress is essential to ensure smooth and successful deployments. By integrating Slack with GitHub, you can receive updates about your deployment status right in your Slack channels. From the start of a deployment to its successful completion or any potential issues, every update can be promptly communicated, allowing for faster responses and efficient troubleshooting.

## 4. Customization and Extensibility

The power of Slack's GitHub integration lies in its customization and extensibility. In this section, we delve deeper into various methods of tailoring Slack and GitHub to achieve a robust, advanced integration.

### 4.1 Exploring the Integration of Slack Bots with GitHub

Slack bots offer a great potential in customizing the interaction with GitHub. By developing and integrating custom Slack bots, you can automate a variety of tasks, receive alerts about specific events, and even command these bots to execute GitHub operations directly from Slack.

For example, a Slack bot can be programmed to respond to a particular command, say "/merge," which could be used by team members to merge a specified GitHub pull request. This not only saves time but also streamlines workflow by avoiding the need to switch between platforms.

Moreover, these bots can also monitor GitHub for changes like new commits, pull requests, or comments, and then alert the team members in the Slack channels.

### 4.2 Building Custom Slack Apps for Advanced GitHub Integration

</SubImageText>

Custom Slack apps offer a step further in integrating GitHub with Slack. They can be built to deliver sophisticated functionalities beyond the scope of bots. Custom Slack apps can integrate deeply with both Slack and GitHub, offering a rich palette of features.

For example, a custom Slack app could be developed to analyze your team's GitHub activities. The app could report on the most active contributors, the number of commits per day, and even predict the project's completion date based on past productivity rates.

Moreover, custom apps can be used to create workflows that cross the boundaries of both platforms. Imagine triggering a complex CI/CD pipeline on GitHub with a simple slash command in Slack. These types of interactions can truly revolutionize the way teams work together.

We wrote a detailed Guide on how to create your first [GitHub bot to send notifications in Slack](https://axolo.co/blog/p/create-your-first-github-bot)

### 4.3 Employing Webhooks for Sophisticated Automation

/>
<SubImageText classNameDiv="" classNameText="lg:w-80 ">
  GitHub webhooks dashboard overview.
</SubImageText>

Webhooks are a powerful way to create sophisticated automation between Slack and GitHub. They allow real-time communication between different servers - in this case, Slack and GitHub.

For instance, a webhook can be created on GitHub that triggers when a new issue is opened. This could instantly notify a specific Slack channel about the issue, complete with a link to it. This instant, automated communication ensures that important updates are not lost in the fray of daily work.

On the other hand, Slack can also send outgoing webhooks to GitHub. For example, an outgoing webhook can be set up in Slack to create a new GitHub issue whenever a particular keyword is mentioned in a Slack channel. This kind of cross-platform automation can greatly increase efficiency and ensure that important discussions are documented as GitHub issues.

### 4.4 Profiling Third-party Slack and GitHub Integrations

Beyond building your own custom bots and apps, there are numerous third-party Slack apps that integrate with GitHub. These apps can extend the capabilities of Slack and GitHub, providing functionalities that can fit any team's unique requirements.

We wrote about the [top 5 GitHub Slack integration for pull requests here](https://axolo.co/blog/p/top-5-github-pull-request-slack-integration). Here is a quick table recap and a video to summarize them all:

## 6. Axolo as a Slack and GitHub Integration

Axolo is an alternative to the official Slack and GitHub integration. It was born to go a step further in helping tech teams be more effective and productive in the way they communicate about pull requests.

### 6.1 Axolo Methodology

<Image
  alt="Axolo Screenshot"
  src="/blog/static/images/top5/axolo_screenshot.png"
  height="637"
  width="1028"
/>

Axolo is unique in its methodology. Unlike most Slack - GitHub bots, Axolo is designed to streamline the process of reviewing pull requests by creating a temporary Slack channel for every GitHub pull request or GitLab merge request. It invites the author and reviewers to the channel and notifies them of relevant events such as code comments, GitHub Actions, Deployments, PR checks, or GitLab CI/CD. Once the pull request is closed or merged, Axolo archives the channel.

This methodology has three main benefits:

1. **Faster Pull Request Merging:** By notifying the right people with the most important event (CI/CD, GitHub actions, code comments and comments) in a dedicated channel, Axolo makes reviewing pull request top of mind for the whole team.
2. **Improved Codebase Quality:** Axolo facilitates comprehensive code reviews by fostering open communication around pull requests, leading to a more refined codebase.
3. **Document conversations:** Before Axolo, discussions happenning in Slack on a specific pull requests were lost. Axolo, with it's two way synch, makes sure that all the conversations are documented in GitHub pull request.

### 6.2 Axolo integration guide

Installing Axolo on a workspace and on GitHub is plug and play but need some admin access both on Slack and GitHub. The best way to do it is to:

1. **Install Axolo on Slack**: You can do that from https://axolo.co

### 7.2 Case Study 2: Reducing Pull Request cycle time by 65% with Agency Analytics

Blake Acheson, the CTO and cofounder of Agency Analytics, has been using Axolo for a year. He shared how Axolo has improved their code review process and reduced their pull request cycle time by 65%.

Before Axolo, the main issue was the inefficient code review process in GitHub. It was quite burdensome and their notification system was far from intuitive. Given the high volume of activity, it was challenging to manage without a user-friendly Slack integration.

After adopting Axolo, the bidirectional communication between GitHub and Slack has transformed their code review process. It has also bolstered their trunk-based development approach. The visibility of code reviews in Slack makes them a top priority for everyone, preventing delays and enabling them to deploy changes to production swiftly.

The transition to using Axolo was smooth. At the beginning, they tested Axolo with just one team. As they grew comfortable with it, it became clear that there was no going back - it was simply a superior way to work. Gradually, they introduced it to the rest of the company.

With Axolo, Agency Analytics has created a more collaborative environment for each pull request. The integration with Axolo has enhanced their communication, allowing for more thorough discussions about the changes proposed in each pull request. This has improved their architectural skills and enabled them to be more discerning before deploying to production.
