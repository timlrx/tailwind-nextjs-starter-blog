summary: Detailed insights from Week 2 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp. Covering workflow orchestration with Mage, specifically using Python and PostgreSQL.
---

Week 2 of the DTC Data Engineering Zoomcamp is all about workflow orchesteration utilizing Mage.  

Orchestration is defined as an important undercurrent of Data Engineering in ***Fundamentals of Data Engineering: Plan and Build Robust Data Systems***
by Joe Reis, Matt Housley, et al. Orchestration tools such as Mage helps us define task dependencies and schedule workflows. You can liken data orchestration to cooking. Depending on the recipe, there are a few steps or tasks involved that are dependent on each others completion before you can proceed to the next task or step.

For example, let's look at the steps involved in cooking my favorite pasta recipe, [Penne alla Vodka](https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a26556220/penne-alla-vodka-recipe/):

1. Bring water to a boil
2. Cook for 10-12 minutes until al dente
3. Mix Pasta with one of our favorite sauces 
4. Top with parmesan & basil prior to serving

Each task is dependent on the completion of the previous task and workflow orchestration is very similair. In the Data Talks Club Week 2 module, [Workflow Orchestration](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/02-workflow-orchestration), [Matt Palmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-palmer/), an Author and Relations Developer at Mage, demonstrates how we can implement ETL pipelines with Mage, a data orchestration framework. You can find the links to the original videos for the module in the readme [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/02-workflow-orchestration/README.md). Matt does a great job with this module, so I recommend you start there.

At a high level, this module covers the following steps:

1. Extract data (New York Taxi data in our case) using a `Data Loader` with `Mage` from an remote endpoint
2. Transform data using a `Transformation` block (perform any desired filtering or data cleansing)
3. Export our data into a data store (in our case, a PostgreSQL database & a Google Cloud Storage bucket) with the `Data Exporter` block.
4. Now our data is ready to be served!

# Configuring Mage

Prior to getting into some of the key components of Mage, we need to setup our environment. If you haven't already, you'll need to clone the [Mage Zoomcamp repository](https://github.com/mage-ai/mage-zoomcamp) provided so we can setup our environment locally. 

Assuming you've already completed the week 1 modules, starting up the environment should be pretty straightforward, but you can refer to the Readme file in the Mage repo if you run into any issues. 

1. Clone repo to vscode
2. Open a terminal in your local repo directory
3. Run the following commands
  ```docker
docker compose build
```
Followed by
```docker
docker compose up
```
4. Navigate to http://localhost:6789 in your browser

Now we can start building our pipeline!

# Building an ETL Pipeline with Mage (postgreSQL)
Mage has a few components that make the code we write highly reusuable. These are what Mage refers to as `Blocks`. There are three type of blocks that we can leverage when creating a pipeline:

1. **Data Loader**
2. **Transformer**
3. **Data Exporter**

The first pipeline we built in the Week 2 module is an ETL pipeline using blocks to load the yellow taxi data from this github repo, transform the data and export the data into a postgres database within our docker container. The resulting DAG should look something like the screenshot below. 

<div class='image-container'>
![mage-first-pipeline](/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-first-pipeline-thumbnail.png)
</div>

## Configuring postgreSQL connection
Before we can get into the pipeline code, we need to first setup a yaml profile in the `io_config.yml` file. This is where we define environmental variables that will
allow us to authenticate to cloud providers, databases, etc. In the instance of the pipeline we are building, we need to define how the pipeline will authenticate
to our postgreSQL database that is running as a service in our docker container, alongside Mage. Navigate over to the `io_config.yml` file in either vscode or the Mage
GUI in your web browser. At the bottom of the file, we need to add the following line:

```yaml
dev:
  POSTGRES_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: 10
  POSTGRES_DBNAME: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_DBNAME') }}"
  POSTGRES_SCHEMA: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_SCHEMA') }}"
  POSTGRES_USER: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_USER') }}"
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_PASSWORD') }}"
  POSTGRES_HOST: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_HOST') }}"
  POSTGRES_PORT: "{{ env_var('POSTGRES_PORT') }}"
```

The `env_var()` is accessing the environmental variables that are defined in our mage-zoomcamp repository in the `.env` file. This allows us to later reference them
in our `data exporter` in order to authenticate to our local postgreSQL instance.

## Data Loader
Let's start by creating a pipeline and adding our first block, a python data loader.

<ToggleGif gifSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-data-loader.gif' staticSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-data-loader-thumbnail.png' alt='Mage Data Loader'/>

Now that we've created our first Mage pipeline and data loader, we need to make some slight modifications to our script. 
It is best practice to define the datatypes prior to performing any transformations which is precisely what we've 
done using the `taxi_dtypes` as a dictionary object. The next variable we defined is `parse_dates_yellow_taxi`
which is a list of date columns to be parsed. You may ask why we did not explicity declare the `tpep_pickup_datetime` and `tpep_dropoff_datetime`
columns in our `taxi_dtypes` dictionary. The reason is date and time data come 
formatted in a variety of ways. The `parse_dates` parameter for the `read_csv` function instructs Pandas to automatically detect and parse these 
different formats into Python datetime objects. Without this, dates might be read as strings or other data types, which are less useful for 
time-based analyses. Simply put, if you try to parse datetime columns as `datetime64` datatypes in `taxi_dtypes` it will throw an error, so use the `parse_dates` parameter instead!


```python
import io
import pandas as pd
import requests
if 'data_loader' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import data_loader
if 'test' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import test


@data_loader
def load_data_from_api(*args, **kwargs):
    """
    Template for loading data from API
    """
    url_yellow_taxi = 'https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/yellow/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv.gz'
    url_green_taxi = 'https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz'

    taxi_dtypes = {
        'VendorID': 'Int64',
        'store_and_fwd_flag': 'str',
        'RatecodeID': 'Int64',
        'PULocationID': 'Int64',
        'DOLocationID': 'Int64',
        'passenger_count': 'Int64',
        'trip_distance': 'float64',
        'fare_amount': 'float64',
        'extra': 'float64',
        'mta_tax': 'float64',
        'tip_amount': 'float64',
        'tolls_amount': 'float64',
        'ehail_fee': 'float64',
        'improvement_surcharge': 'float64',
        'total_amount': 'float64',
        'payment_type': 'float64',
        'trip_type': 'float64',
        'congestion_surcharge': 'float64'
    }

    parse_dates_green_taxi = ['lpep_pickup_datetime', 'lpep_dropoff_datetime']
    parse_dates_yellow_taxi = ['tpep_pickup_datetime', 'tpep_dropoff_datetime']

    return pd.read_csv(url_yellow_taxi, sep=',', compression='gzip', dtype=taxi_dtypes, parse_dates=parse_yellow_green_taxi)


@test
def test_output(output, *args) -> None:
    """
    Template code for testing the output of the block.
    """
    assert output is not None, 'The output is undefined'

```

## Transformer

Now that we've defined our data loader, it's time to transform our data. This is where `Transformation` blocks in Mage come in to play. Adding one to our pipeline is fairly straight forward, we simply scroll down to the bottom of the most recent block and click `Transformer` which will create a new transformation block with whichever name we decide to use, I called mine `transform_taxi_data`.

<ToggleGif gifSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-transformer-block.gif' staticSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-transformer-block-thumbnail.png' alt='Mage Data Transformer'/>

Now that the block has been created, we need to apply a few simple filters to the taxi data we have loaded. The key transformation here is `non_zero_passengers_df` which essentially filters out any row in the dataset where the passenger count is zero. We also perform a count on the number of records where the `passenger_count` is 
not zero in the `non_zero_passengers_count` dataframe, priopr to returning the `non_zero_passenger_df` to be passed to the `Data Exporter` block.

```python
if 'transformer' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import transformer
if 'test' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import test

import pandas as pd

@transformer
def transform(data, *args, **kwargs):
    # Specify your transformation logic here

    zero_passengers_df = data[data['passenger_count'].isin([0])]
    zero_passengers_count = zero_passengers_df['passenger_count'].count()
    non_zero_passengers_df = data[data['passenger_count'] > 0]
    non_zero_passengers_count = non_zero_passengers_df['passenger_count'].count()
    print(f'Preprocessing: records with zero passengers: {zero_passengers_count}')
    print(f'Preprocessing: records with 1 passenger or more: {non_zero_passengers_count}')

    return non_zero_passengers_df


@test
def test_output(output, *args) -> None:
    """
    Template code for testing the output of the block.
    """
    assert output['passenger_count'].isin([0]).sum() == 0, 'There are rides with zero passengers'
```


## Data Exporter

Finally, it is time to export our data! This step is fairly straight forward, add a `Data Exporter` block similair to how we added our data loader and transformer. I've named mine `ingest_taxi_data_postgres`. In this data exporter, we define 3 variables, `schema_name`, `table_name` and `config_profile`. 
`schema_name` and `table_name` will be later used to query our postgreSQL database. i.e., `SELECT * FROM ny_taxi.yellow_taxi_data`. Setting the `config_profile`
profile to `dev` instead of `default` allows us to access the `dev` profile in the `io_config.yaml` in which we previously defined our postgreSQL connection details.

```python
from mage_ai.settings.repo import get_repo_path
from mage_ai.io.config import ConfigFileLoader
from mage_ai.io.postgres import Postgres
from pandas import DataFrame
from os import path

if 'data_exporter' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import data_exporter

@data_exporter
def export_data_to_postgres(df: DataFrame, **kwargs) -> None:

    schema_name = 'ny_taxi'  # Specify the name of the schema to export data to
    table_name = 'yellow_taxi_data'  # Specify the name of the table to export data to
    config_path = path.join(get_repo_path(), 'io_config.yaml')
    config_profile = 'dev'

    with Postgres.with_config(ConfigFileLoader(config_path, config_profile)) as loader:
        loader.export(
            df,
            schema_name,
            table_name,
            index=False,  # Specifies whether to include index in exported table
            if_exists='replace',  # Specify resolution policy if table name already exists
        )

```

## Execute Pipeline

Now that we've created our ETL pipeline and added all of the necessary blocks, it is time to execute our pipeline! Let's take a look at our finished DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which is a fancy way of describing a tree view of our pipeline, its blocks and dependencies, etc. 

*Note: you can drag in drop the block connections/dependencies in the tree view of Mage, which is useful when dealing with multiple pipeline blocks.*

<div class='image-container'>
![mage-dag](/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-dag.png)
</div>

Now lets execute our pipeline! Right click the three dots in the top corner of the `Data Exporter` block
and select `Execute with all upstream blocks`. This may take a few seconds to run due to the size of the 
dataset we are ingesting/exporting into postgreSQL.

<ToggleGif gifSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-execute-pipeline.gif' staticSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-execute-pipeline-thumbnail.png' alt='Execute Mage Pipeline'/>


## Testing Pipeline Output (PostgreSQL)

Lastly, I added a data loader for the sake of testing the output of our pipeline. You can add one as well, by using a `SQL Data Loader` that Mage provides. Once you create the block, you'll need to configure the exporter to use `PostgreSQL` as it's connection and `dev` as the YAML profile. Then you can use the following command to query our newly created database.

```sql
SELECT * FROM ny_taxi.yellow_taxi_data LIMIT 10
```

# Building an ETL Pipeline with Mage (Google Cloud)

Next up in the Week 2 module, we are tasked with creating an ETL pipeline similair to our first, the key difference being we are exporting our dataset to a Google Cloud Bucket instead of PostgreSQL. This requires a few additional steps that we will cover in the section below.

## Create a cloud storage account

## Create a service account
If you need a refresher on creating a GCP service account, you can refer back to my week 1 blog post [here](./de-zc-w1-2#configuring-a-gcp-service-account).

## Download JSON keys
You will also need to download a JSON key in order to authenticate to our new service account, which I've also touched on in last weeks blog [here](./de-zc-w1-2#download-an-api-key-for-your-service-account).

## Update Mage Configuration (Environmental Variables)
Now with our google cloud storage and service account created, we need to update the `io_config.yaml` file within the Mage repository either via the Mage GUI interface or vscode to source our newly created JSON keys.

Update the following YAML block under `# Google` by first deleting the
`GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY` variable and it's child properties.

```YAML
  GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY:
    type: service_account
    project_id: project-id
    private_key_id: key-id
    private_key: "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nyour_private_key\n-----END_PRIVATE_KEY"
    client_email: your_service_account_email
    auth_uri: "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
    token_uri: "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token"
    auth_provider_x509_cert_url: "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
    client_x509_cert_url: "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your_service_account_email"

  GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY_FILEPATH: "/path/to/your/service/account/key.json"
  GOOGLE_LOCATION: US # Optional
```

What's left should be

```YAML
  GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY_FILEPATH: "/path/to/your/service/account/key.json"
  GOOGLE_LOCATION: US # Optional
```
Now you can copy the JSON key in your downloads folder over to the Mage-Zoomcamp repo we are working out of. When you switch over to the Terminal in Mage and run ```shell ls -la``` you should see your JSON key within the directory. This is because in `docker-compose.yml` we mounted the volume: 

```yaml 
volumes:
    - .:/home/src/
```

So the code underneath the `# Google` block in `io_config.yml` should look as follows:

```YAML
  GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACC_KEY_FILEPATH: "/home/src/dtc-de-zoomcamp-12345678.json"
  GOOGLE_LOCATION: US # Optional
```

Just to clarify, these yaml variables should be added under the `default` profile and not the `dev` profile we previously created.

## Testing Mage connection to GCP

Now that we've tested our connection to GCP is working, we will want to create a new pipeline for the sake of ingesting our NY taxi data into GCP. I've named my pipeline `ingest_taxi_data_gcp`.

This is where Mage begins to shine, because we already have reusable code blocks that we previously created in our `ingest_taxi_data_postgres` pipeline that we can drag and drop into our new pipeline.

Let's give it a try!


<ToggleGif gifSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-drag-drop-blocks.gif' staticSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-drag-drop-blocks-thumbnail.png' alt='Default'/>


After adding the `load_api_data` block, we need to add our transformation block as well as our data exporter block.

We will need to create a new Data Exporter block in order to ingest our taxi data into our Google Cloud Storage container. Be sure to select `Python > Google Cloud Storage` when creating the exporter.

<ToggleGif gifSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-data-exporter.gif' staticSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-data-exporter-thumbnail.png' alt='Default'/>

Finally, one thing I've noticed when reusing a code block that was previously created in another pipeline, it is not automatically tied as a dependency to the other blocks we created, therefore we need to connect it as a dependcy via drag and drop in the tree view. I named my exporter `taxi_data_to_gcs_parquet`.

<ToggleGif gifSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-connect-blocks-1.gif' staticSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-connect-blocks-1-thumbnail.png' alt='Default'/>

Now that we've connected all of the blocks, we must modify the code in our Data Exporter, `taxi_to_gcs_parquet`, to match the name of the cloud storage bucket we set up earlier.

```python
bucket_name = 'your_bucket_name'
object_key = 'ny_taxi_data.parquet'
```

Once the variables have been updated, we can now run our pipleine. To do this, click the 3 dots in the top corner of the `taxi_to_gcs_parquet` block and select `Execute with all upstream blocks`, which runs everything in sequential order.

After you run the pipeline, be sure to check your storage bucket to confirm the output is as expected. It should look as follows:

<div class='image-container'>
![mage-pipeline-output](/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-pipeline-result.png)
</div>

## Partitioning with Parquet Files
Like most things, no two datasets are created equal. A solution that works for ingesting a smaller dataset may not be optimal for a much larger dataset or a dataset that will increase in scale as time passes. This is why `chunk sizing` can be a useful tool when dealing with larger files. In the Week 1 Module, we explicity implement chunk sizing with a for loop to slice our dataframe into smaller sections and ingest the chunks sequentially, which is better for memory management and effeciency in general. If you are curious of how this is implemnted, you can look back at the following section of my [week 1 blog post](https://www.jonahboliver.com/blog/de-zc-w1#building-a-python-ingestion-script). 

In our current module, we implement another concenpt that isn't necessarily identical, but came to mind when I was going through this module. In the following section, we utilize the `pyarrow` python library, except instead of chunk sizing (dividing a dataset into smaller subsets where each chunk contains a fixed number of records or rows) we are applying column partitioning (dividing datasets based on the values of one or more columns). 

The result is instead of ingesting **one** file into our cloud storage bucket `ny_taxi_data.parquet`, we ingest multiple in the form of partitioned parquet files by date, the file structure would look something like the following:

```
ny_taxi_data/
  tpep_pickup_date=2021-01-01/
  tpep_pickup_date=2021-01-02/
  tpep_pickup_date=2021-01-03/
  ...
  ... 
```

Let's implement this! First, create a `Data Exporter` and attach it to our `Transformer` block. We can run this in parallel with the previous `Data Exporter`
we created. You can name the new exporter block something like `taxi_to_gcs_partitioned_parquet` and the python code should look as follows (be sure to update the variables to reflect the project id of your GCP project, the bucket name, etc.):


```python
import pyarrow as pa
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
from pandas import DataFrame
import os

if 'data_exporter' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import data_exporter

# update the variables below
os.environ['GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS'] = '/home/src/dtc-de-zoomcamp-12345-de12345678.json'
project_id = 'dtc-de-zoomcamp-12345'
bucket_name = 'mage-zoomcamp-jonah-oliver'
object_key = 'ny_taxi_data.parquet'
table_name = 'ny_taxi_data'
root_path = f'{bucket_name}/{table_name}'


@data_exporter
def export_data_to_google_cloud_storage(df: DataFrame, **kwargs) -> None:
    # creating a new date column from the existing datetime column
    df['tpep_pickup_date'] = df['tpep_pickup_datetime'].dt.date

    table = pa.Table.from_pandas(df)

    gcs = pa.fs.GcsFileSystem()

    pq.write_to_dataset(
        table,
        root_path=root_path,
        partition_cols=['tpep_pickup_date'],
        filesystem=gcs
    )
```
## GCS to BigQuery

# Scheduling a Workflow (Automating Pipeline)

A key component in Data Orchestration is scheduling our workflows, in other words, automating our pipelines to run based on triggers. Mage defines three triggers that I'm aware of:

- Schedule
- Event
- API

We can add a Schedule Trigger to automate our pipeline to run just once, daily or even on an hourly cadence. 

<ToggleGif gifSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-pipeline-trigger.gif' staticSrc='/static/images/de-zc/w2/mage-pipeline-trigger-thumbnail.png' alt='Mage pipeline trigger'/>

# Parameterization
If you recall back to the python ingestion script we wrote in [week 1](https://jonahboliver.com/blog/de-zc-w1#building-a-python-ingestion-script), we used the python library `argparse` to pass in arguments or parameters into our python script upon running the docker container in the command terminal. Parameters such as our username, password, database, table and the url of our taxi data csv file. The alternative to this is to define these parameters as variables in the python script itself, but parameterizing our pipelines allows us more flexibility. 

Parametrization can allow us to call a pipeline on demand for a specified date. Perhaps we notice some missing data in a SQL database which is serving as a data store for an automated pipeline. One way you could go about handling this is to add a date parameter that you can pass into a script which will allow you to execute a pipeline for that specific date. This is generally know as `backfilling` which is covered later in this module. There are methods to automating backfilling, but I like to use it as an example to explain paramterization.

We can use parameters within Mage, similair to how we've previously implemented it, but with some slight differences.

Let's add an additional `Data Exporter` to our pre-existing pipeline so we can implement some parameters. The parameter we are adding is the `execution_date` which is a built in parameter that is created when executing the pipeline code. We are assigning the execution date to a variable named `now` and then using the `strftime()` function, which stands for "string format time", to convert a datetime object into a string format of our choosing. This can be useful for applying a consistent naming format to our files for storage.

***Pro tip: You can use the shortcut commands `CTRL-K-C` & `CTRL-K-U` to comment out blocks of code at a time. Use `CTRL-K-C` to uncomment the commented out block of code below when you are ready for the script to export your data.***

```python
from mage_ai.settings.repo import get_repo_path
from mage_ai.io.config import ConfigFileLoader
from mage_ai.io.google_cloud_storage import GoogleCloudStorage
from pandas import DataFrame
from os import path

if 'data_exporter' not in globals():
    from mage_ai.data_preparation.decorators import data_exporter


@data_exporter
def export_data_to_google_cloud_storage(df: DataFrame, **kwargs) -> None:
    
    now = kwargs.get('execution_date')
    print(now) # Output: '2024-01-25 18:42:18.783257' (example output)

    now_fpath = now.strftime('%Y/%m/%d')
    print(now_fpath) # Output: '2024/01/25' (example output)

    bucket_name = 'mage-zoomcamp-jonah-oliver'
    object_key = f'{now_fpath}/daily-trips.parquet'
    print(object_key) # Output: 2024/01/25/daily-trips.parquet (example output)

    config_path = path.join(get_repo_path(), 'io_config.yaml')
    config_profile = 'default'

    # GoogleCloudStorage.with_config(ConfigFileLoader(config_path, config_profile)).export(
    #     df,
    #     bucket_name,
    #     object_key,
    # )

```

# Looking Ahead
