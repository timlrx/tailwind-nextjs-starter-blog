> Writing tests is another way to look the code and locally understand it and reuse it, and that is the same goal of good Object Oriented design. This is the reason of the deep synergy between testability and good design.

<p>— Michael Feathers</p>

---

> Code without tests is bad code. It doesn’t matter how well written it is; it doesn’t matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don’t know if our code is getting better or worse.
 
<p>— Michael Feathers</p>

> TDD does not drive towards good design, it drives away from a bad design. If you know what good design is, the result is a better design.

<p>— Nat Pryce</p>

---

> TDD doesn't drive good design. TDD gives you immediate feedback about what is likely to be bad design.
 
<p>— Kent Beck</p>

---

> The best way that I know to write code is to shape it from the beginning with tests.
 
<p>— Ron Jeffries</p>

---

> TDD approach appears to yield code with superior external code quality, as measured by conformance to a set of black box test cases when compared with code developed with a more traditional waterfall-like model practice.
 
<p>— Boby George, Laurie Williams "An Initial Investigation of Test Driven Development in Industry"</p>

---

> TDD approach facilitates simpler design and that lack of upfront design is not a hindrance.
 
<p>— Boby George, Laurie Williams "An Initial Investigation of Test Driven Development in Industry"</p>

---

> Future releases of these products, as they continue using TDD, will also experience low defect densities due to the use of these test assets.
 
<p>— "Realizing quality improvement through test driven development: results and experiences of four industrial teams"</p>

I jeszcze jeden, bardzo trafny w kontekście:

> No tool nor technique can survive inadequately trained developer.
 
<p>— Steve Freeman</p>
