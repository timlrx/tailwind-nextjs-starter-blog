Looking for ways to more effectively track your Jira tasks and stay up-to-date with important project updates? Integrating Jira with Slack is a great way to improve your productivity as a developer. You can easily keep on top of your tasks, collaborate with your team, and stay informed about any changes to your projects. Whether you're looking for a simple integration that sends notifications from Jira to Slack or a more comprehensive solution that allows you to manage issues from within Slack, there is an integration out there that can help meet your needs. So why wait? Start exploring our top 3 Jira Slack integrations.

## The official Jira Slack integration

### Benefits of using the official Jira Slack integration

#### Stay in sync

Tired of always providing status updates? Allow Jira to automatically transmit updates to team Slack channels so you don't have to keep your coworkers up to date on everything. Receive notifications when issues are created, modified, transitioned, commented on, and so on. Filter by issue type and priority to ensure that your team only sees what is important in your channel. With individualized notifications in a DM with @Jira, Jira and Slack can help you stay on top of your own work.

#### See previews

When you provide a link to a Jira issue or mention an issue key, @Jira will display the key data to keep you focused on the conversation.

#### Take actions from Slack

Slack may be used to create Jira tickets, alter ticket status, assign teammates, and more.
